## Overview

This repo includes my solution about Programming Assignments of UCF-CAP-5415-Fall, which is a course about computer vision.

It's required to use MATLAB offcially, but I write code in Python, plus some open-source modules like `OpenCV` and `Matplotlib`.
Hope this can be a little bit helpful.

For each PA, please refer to the corresponding sub-directory for detail.


Feel free to modify the code with your idea.
